🧠 Redux Toolkit Setup (RTK)

We’re using Redux Toolkit (RTK) to handle almost all dynamic data in this project. Everything related to Redux is organized inside:

src/redux/

🔧 Store

- The main file is:  
  src/redux/store.js
- This is where all slices are combined.
- It tracks and manages the global app state.

✂️ Slices (Features)

- You’ll find three slices under:  
  src/redux/features/
- Each slice handles a specific part of the state (like auth, posts, etc.).
- They include their own state, reducers, and actions.

🛠️ How It Works

useSelector  
Used to read data from the Redux store in any component.

Example:

// this one is for extracting data from RTK
const someData = useSelector((state) => state.sliceName.someData);

useDispatch  
Used to send actions (like fetching or updating data).

Example:

// this one is for sending query to RTK
const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(someAction());
